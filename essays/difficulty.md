## Introduction
I am new to Javascript. I have prior knowledge regarding programming languages such as Java and C. Since this is my first time using this, I find it hard and challenging. When I compare it to Java, I find it easier to do as it is very similar in terms of codes and syntax used. Since we are using fiddle to do our codes instead of Eclipse, I find it more comfortable to do. 

## My Javascript progression
I learned so many things about doing Javascript and ES6. The freeCodeCamp was extremely helpful for me to understand how Javascript and ES6 works. It was lengthy and time consuming, but it was worth it. Having hands-on experience and practical exercises made it more enjoyable learning experience.

Although I am not yet fully exposed to Javascript and software engineering, just the way how I learned and understood it, I can definitely agree that it is a good programming language from a software engineering perspective as it is being used mostly by the industry so learning it as early as now is an advantage.

## What can I say in this class?
Athletic software engineering in my opinion will make us more productive and a fast problem solver in the field. I find the practice WOD very useful although it is very challenging and requires a lot of effort and knowledge about the topic. The style of learning in this class is very efficient and effective as it reduces the teaching time and maximizing the learning of each student. I can view the modules in my convenient time and can review them as many times that I want compared to having a lecture day. The meeting time can be used for problem solving, asking clarification and practical application regarding the topic. I find it enjoyable as I learn new things in class. This style of learning will surely work for me.
