<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Learning a new programming language is difficult and complicated. You need to dedicate time and effort to learn. There is a saying that practice makes perfect. This was the same feeling that I experience regarding UI Frameworks. After a few weeks of learning this new framework, I get very frustrated. There are a lot of information to learn about this topic. I feel overwhelmed that sometimes I forget and get confused.</p>

<h2 id="website-recreation">Website recreation</h2>
<p>One of our tasks in class is to choose a website that we want to copy and use Bootstrap 5. I get to make a copy of Foodland website. Although it looks simple, I had a hard time to recreate the website. However, I was able to do the task and was able to recreate the website. We had different tasks to recreate different websites during the practice WOD (Workout of the Day) and the actual WOD. I feel very upset and frustrated that even though I have the resources on how to do the tasks, I was not able to finish them on time. I will not lose hope with what happened, in fact, it will make me more engage with this topic. I know that I will use this in the future especially if I will be working in a company.</p>

<h2 id="generalization">Generalization</h2>
<p>In conclusion, I can say that every hardwork will pay off in the future. Learning UI Frameworks is complicated, however, through practice I can definitely apply it especially when I graduate.</p>
