## Introduction
Every beginning has an end. It has come to the point where everything that has started for Spring 2023 should come to an end. I felt a lot of mix emotions from being sad because of not finishing some of the Workouts of the Day (WOD) for my Software Engineering class to being happy because I was able to finish our final project as a group. However, this does not mean that learning should also stop! Learning is a never-ending journey!

## Lessons learned

Ethics in Software Engineering is one of the lessons that were discussed. With the advancement of technology, some of the concerns are privacy and security. People want their identity to be private and secured. I learned about the general ethical principles for a computing professional in the future like me which includes contributing to society and human well-being, and acknowleges that everyone are stakeholders in the field of computing, avoiding harm and discrimination in every case, being honest, fair and trustworthy, respect for privacy and work, and honoring confidentiality. As I progress being a computing professional, I should adhere with this principles because it is for the good of everyone.

Coding standards is another topic that were discussed in my Software Engineering class. What does it really mean to become a Software Engineer? We were presented with a blog [five programming problems every Software Engineer should be able to solve in less than 1 hour](https://web.archive.org/web/20200414191515/http://www.shiftedup.com/2015/05/07/five-programming-problems-every-software-engineer-should-be-able-to-solve-in-less-than-1-hour) by Santiago Valdarrama. In the blog, a Software Engineer is expected to solve a problem using code. 

## Generalization
In conclusion, design patterns are template to solve a commonly encountered problem in software design that you can reuse. There are different types of design patterns such as Prototype, Observer, MVC, Front Controller, Singleton, and Factory Method. Like any other profession, having a reference to a particular problem can be of great help and can make ite easier in working on a task and that is why design patterns are here for.
