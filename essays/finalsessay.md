## Introduction
Software Engineering II (ICS 414) is an elective class in the BS Computer Science program. This Spring 2024 semester, it only has one class and it gets filled out quickly. I was able to register on this class on the first day of class since one of the previously registered student dropped the class. I still need one elective in order to graduate this semester and I chose this class.

## Lessons learned in my Software Engineering II class



## Generalization
In conclusion, we always need to learn, it is a never-ending journey, that makes an individual successful in any field. There were a lot of topics that were discussed in my Software Engineering class. Two of those that have really stuck in my mind are Ethics in Software Engineering and Coding Standards. This semester has not been an easy one, there are times that you fail and succeed. The only important thing is what you have learned and how would you apply it in your career. Never stop learning!
