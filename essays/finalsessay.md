## Introduction
Software Engineering II (ICS 414) is an elective class in the BS Computer Science program. This Spring 2024 semester, it only has one class offered and it gets filled out quickly. I was able to register on this course on the first day of classes since one of the previously registered students dropped the class. I still need one elective to graduate this semester and I chose this class. This course is a continuation of the things that I learned from Software Engineering I. It deals with project management, quality, and productivity control, testing and validation, and team management.

## Lessons learned in my Software Engineering II class
On the first week of class, we were informed about how the class will be done. We were given a client, that wants to have a website regarding volunteering opportunities. She gave her idea and instructions on how the website will look like and how it functions. We were group in teams according to the professorâ€™s discretion. It is hard to work in teams where you do not know each other well. 

## Generalization
In conclusion, we always need to learn, it is a never-ending journey, that makes an individual successful in any field. There were a lot of topics that were discussed in my Software Engineering class. Two of those that have really stuck in my mind are Ethics in Software Engineering and Coding Standards. This semester has not been an easy one, there are times that you fail and succeed. The only important thing is what you have learned and how would you apply it in your career. Never stop learning!
