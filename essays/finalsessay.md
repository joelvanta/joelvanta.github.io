## Introduction
My experience

## Lessons learned in my Software Engineering II class



## Generalization
In conclusion, we always need to learn, it is a never-ending journey, that makes an individual successful in any field. There were a lot of topics that were discussed in my Software Engineering class. Two of those that have really stuck in my mind are Ethics in Software Engineering and Coding Standards. This semester has not been an easy one, there are times that you fail and succeed. The only important thing is what you have learned and how would you apply it in your career. Never stop learning!
