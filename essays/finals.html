<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Every beginning has an end. It has come to the point where everything that has started for Spring 2023 should come to an end. I felt a lot of mix emotions from being sad because of not finishing some Workouts of the Day (WOD) for my Software Engineering class to being happy because I was able to finish our final project as a group. However, this does not mean that learning should also stop! Learning is a never-ending journey!</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned-in-my-software-engineering-class">Lessons learned in my Software Engineering class</h2>

<p>Ethics in Software Engineering is one of the lessons that were discussed. With the advancement of technology, some concerns are privacy and security. People want their identity to be private and secured. I learned about the general ethical principles for a computing professional in the future like me which includes contributing to society and human well-being, and acknowledges that everyone are stakeholders in the field of computing, avoiding harm and discrimination in every case, being honest, fair and trustworthy, respect for privacy and work, and honoring confidentiality. As I progress being a computing professional, I should adhere with these principles because it is for the good of everyone.</p>

<p>Coding standards is another topic that were discussed in my Software Engineering class. What does it really mean to become a Software Engineer? We were presented with a blog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200414191515/http://www.shiftedup.com/2015/05/07/five-programming-problems-every-software-engineer-should-be-able-to-solve-in-less-than-1-hour">five programming problems every Software Engineer should be able to solve in less than 1 hour</a> by Santiago Valdarrama. In the blog, a Software Engineer is expected to solve a problem using code. Coding standard is important for a Software Engineer like me because it makes sure that your code is readable in case somebody tries to look at it. It will remove coding mistakes associated with the programming language or library that was used. Coding standard thus ensures the quality of the code everyone make. The good news is you donâ€™t need to do it manually, there are tools readily available to ensure that your code follows the coding standards.</p>

<h2 id="generalization">Generalization</h2>
<p>In conclusion, we always need to learn, it is a never-ending journey, that makes an individual successful in any field. There were a lot of topics that were discussed in my Software Engineering class. Two of those that have really stuck in my mind are Ethics in Software Engineering and Coding Standards. This semester has not been an easy one, there are times that you fail and succeed. The only important thing is what you have learned and how would you apply it in your career. Never stop learning!</p>
