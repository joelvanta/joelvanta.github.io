summary: "Promenade night in Ganado High School, Arizona"
---

It was a night to remember for the students of Ganado High School in Arizona. I was assigned to be the Junior class sponsor of the school during the 2014-2015 academic year. Being the Junior class sponsor, one of the task is to plan for the prom night. I was the main in-charge of the prom night where I facilitate and coordinate regarding this event.

## The planning and preparation stage
I conducted a meeting with the whole Junior class to discuss about the theme of the prom night. The whole class agreed to have a masquerade theme. I delegated the task to some of the students regarding preparation, decoration, food, venue, and program for the event. I was the one who collected payment for those who are attending the event.

## The actual event night
There was a strict security presence before the event started. Those who attended were all dressed and wearing masks. During the event proper, everyone participated and enjoyed the music and the program that was prepared by the students. There was no incident that happened which I was thankful for. 

Overall, being the overall in-charge was difficult. However, if you know how to delegate tasks and manage time, and everything will be executed according to plan, it would not be that difficult to do.
