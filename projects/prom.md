summary: "Promenade night in Ganado High School, Arizona"
---

It was a night to remember for the students of Ganado High School in Arizona. I was assigned to be the Junior class sponsor of the school during the 2014-2015 academic year. Being the Junior class sponsor, one of the task is to plan for the prom night. I was the main in-charge of the prom night where I facilitate and coordinate regarding this event.

##The planning and preparation stage
I conducted a meeting with the whole Junior class to discuss about the theme of the prom night. The whole class agreed to have a masquerade theme. I delegated the task to some of the students regarding preparation, decoration, venue, and program for the event. I was the one who collected payment for those who are attending the event.
