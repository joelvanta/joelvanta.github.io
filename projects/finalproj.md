## Introduction
As a final project for my ICS 314 class(Software Engineering I), we were tasked to make a working webpage that could help the University of Hawaii community. We created a webpage that can list items that people want to get rid of, or items that can be reuse by other people.


Overall, the project was successful. There are some minor improvements that should be done such as proper object recognition since it needs a lot of pictures to store in its memory to identify a certain object as well as the color.
