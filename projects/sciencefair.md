---

As a former science teacher, we organize our annual Science Fair in our high school. I am one of the committee that is in charge with the preparation of the event. I was the one in charge of collecting entries, setting up the tables, and the venue for the science fair. During this year, I was able to collect about 20 entries. The topics varied from Earth Science, Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. 

During the event, the students were able to demonstrate and apply the knowledge and skills that they learn in the field of science. Everyone who attended the event were impressed about the ideas that were presented by our students. One of the students was chosen to participate in the State Science Fair.

It was a stressful event for me, although it became a successful one because of the team effort by our Science Department. There were minor issues but these were resolved in a rightful manner.
